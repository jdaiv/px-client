Hey, this isn't done yet, comeback later!

A prototype for a multiplayer frontend. Built with Preact and a custom WebGL2 renderer.

Features:

 - GPU powered particles.
 - A sorta almost working GLTF pipeline.
 - Working multiplayer!
 - Lots of spaghetti under the hood.
 - Rudimentary chat.
 - Low CPU usage.
